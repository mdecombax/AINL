The new Last of us, or Mario or elder scrolls will still be grand. And people will still buy it. One does not have to cancel out the other.\n\nWe adapt. And if you want to set in a cart while a horse takes you around a park you can. Because while we adapt we cherish the past if it means something to us. You can still buy records of new music.

            "Hi there, we've built a graph-based workflow builder for web agents. Our DSL lets you orchestrate LLM-powered web actions with loops, conditionals and memory. Here is a 1 min demo: [https://youtu.be/4AQfl5Gj\\_Ro](https://youtu.be/4AQfl5Gj_Ro)\n\nWe tried out existing web agents and found zero-shot planning unreliable for longer workflows. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve built a framework that lets you define a graph-based workflow. Every action is modelled as a node and edges between nodes define the next action to take.\n\nThere are two different node type categories: Low-level browser interaction nodes and high-level reasoning nodes. Low-level nodes are actions like clicking, inputing text or navigating to a new URL. High-level nodes are able to extract structured data from a webpage or make a conditional decision based on the content of the webpage.\n\nAll of the nodes can be configured with a prompt in natural language. For instance, if you had a list of websites you could define a click-node with a prompt ‚ÄúClick on the contact page‚Äù. This ensures that workflows generalize to different websites independent of the layout.\n\nOur early users use us to automate tasks like:\n\n1. Find the contact information of fire department chiefs in the US\n2. Check the HR information of all employees registered on Gusto\n3. Automate background research on people they have meetings with in Google Calendar\n\nWe just released our chrome extension where you can build & run workflows for yourself. Its free for up to 200 browser actions a month. We‚Äôd love for you to try it and give us feedback. You can find the link to our extension through our landing page: [https://cloudcruise.com/](https://cloudcruise.com/)\n\nLast but not least, here are some of the strange things we‚Äôve encountered so far whilst automating the web:\n\n1. Ancient relics like this website using a frameset instead of a body tag: [http://wantaghfd.com/](http://wantaghfd.com/)\n2. This animation showing why having a dance off on a balcony is catastrophic: [https://balcony1.com/](https://balcony1.com/)\n3. A big company violating RFC 2616 by sending back an undefined HTTP status code 999",
            "This is great, but shouldn't there be an option to describe what you want in normal speech and have the LLM generate the graph for your approval?",
