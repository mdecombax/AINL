            "Meh, just means the abstraction layer moves up. At the end of the day no one is coding in machine code. Languages and libraries moved the abstraction up.\n\nI certainly agree that solving problems for customers is going to be key. But there are going to be even more frameworks and libraries to master (with AI's help of course.)\n\nWe are not far away from a specialized AI reading a SaaS documentation and building the data model, biz logic and front end for us.\n\nOr designing a game engine will focus on the fun stuff rather than all of the chicken-sh!t low level stuff.\n\nI also think its going to open up what can be done. Think of a great app idea, but then you realize the weeks or months of work involved. That cycle can be minimized and you can be testing an idea in days.\n\nDeveloping apps is not going away, its just going to get a lot more fun. I also see the amount of work to be done increasing vs decreasing.\n\nEdit: I also think most tech leaders today are dinosaurs staring at the meteor. AI is a completely different animal and the leaders of today are not going to be the leaders of tomorrow. The big companies are struggling hard to learn to think differently.",
            "Eventually that will happen for 90% of developers.  But we are a long way from that with current LLMs.  Can they code? Yes. But rarely does a one shot work as expected.  They cant manage even mildly complex projects. The context windows are too small too, by an order of magnitude.  At the rate models are progressing, it will be a few years and a whole lot more compute.",
            "IYH \"Coding is just kind of like the language that we talk to computers. It's not necessarily the skill in and of itself,\" the executive said. \"The skill in and of itself is like, how do I innovate? How do I go build something that's interesting for my end users to use?\"\n\n**This means the job of a software developer will change, Garman said.**\n\n\"It just means that each of us has to get more in tune with what our customers need and what the actual end thing is that we're going to try to go build, because that's going to be more and more of what the work is as opposed to sitting down and actually writing code,\" he said.\n\n**Talk of AI changing and even eliminating jobs has intensified lately as companies lay off employees or stop hiring to shift resources toward AI development. New AI tools that automatically generate code can help companies do more with the same number of engineers or fewer of these pricey employees. AWS laid off hundreds of employees earlier this year.**\n\nIn Garman's case, he was sharing advice rather than issuing a dire warning that developers will go extinct because of AI. His tone was optimistic, suggesting more creative opportunities for developers. He said AWS was helping employees \"continue to upskill and learn about new technologies\" to increase their productivity with the help of AI.\n\n**\"Being a developer in 2025 may be different than what it was as a developer in 2020,\" Garman added.\"**",
            "If all you code is mindless template apps or things with very well-known patterns, then yes, this may be true. \n\nI can tell you in my own experience, as a mathematician who frequently has to design and implement novel statistics, AI is beyond useless for my coding needs.",
            "What can't reasonably be argued is that developers will not only be more productive when it comes to coding, but also more confident in the higher-level decisions they make.\n\nThat means middle management will become less relevant when AI can manage your project and define milestones. Even if the code is written with AI, someone knowledgeable will have to oversee not only the code itself but manage the whole life cycle.\n\nDevelopers' jobs will just be a bit more high-level.",
            "First it was punch cards, then hand coded machine code, then assembly, then really procedural high level languages like COBOL (which was sold as a framework which would allow non engineers to code solutions hmmmm… not much changes), then object orientated languages, and now LLM assisted coding.\n\nI’m not too worried. If an AI can do what I do now better than I can then it has attained sentience and super intelligence and all bets are off for everyone",
            "30/60wpm coding was steady and grindy in comparison to the amount of brainpower will be required to efficiently chain prompt and instruct multiple AIs simultaneously, like inserting punch cards was far less intense IO than a cloud CLI"

            "It's becoming clear that with all the brain and consciousness theories out there, the proof will be in the pudding. By this I mean, can any particular theory be used to create a human adult level conscious machine. My bet is on the late Gerald Edelman's Extended Theory of Neuronal Group Selection. The lead group in robotics based on this theory is the Neurorobotics Lab at UC at Irvine. Dr. Edelman distinguished between primary consciousness, which came first in evolution, and that humans share with other conscious animals, and higher order consciousness, which came to only humans with the acquisition of language. A machine with only primary consciousness will probably have to come first.\n\n\n\nWhat I find special about the TNGS is the Darwin series of automata created at the Neurosciences Institute by Dr. Edelman and his colleagues in the 1990's and 2000's. These machines perform in the real world, not in a restricted simulated world, and display convincing physical behavior indicative of higher psychological functions necessary for consciousness, such as perceptual categorization, memory, and learning. They are based on realistic models of the parts of the biological brain that the theory claims subserve these functions. The extended TNGS allows for the emergence of consciousness based only on further evolutionary development of the brain areas responsible for these functions, in a parsimonious way. No other research I've encountered is anywhere near as convincing.\n\n\n\nI post because on almost every video and article about the brain and consciousness that I encounter, the attitude seems to be that we still know next to nothing about how the brain and consciousness work; that there's lots of data but no unifying theory. I believe the extended TNGS is that theory. My motivation is to keep that theory in front of the public. And obviously, I consider it the route to a truly conscious machine, primary and higher-order.\n\n\n\nMy advice to people who want to create a conscious machine is to seriously ground themselves in the extended TNGS and the Darwin automata first, and proceed from there, by applying to Jeff Krichmar's lab at UC Irvine, possibly. Dr. Edelman's roadmap to a conscious machine is at [https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10461](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10461)",
            "When you see discussions about AI developing consciousness, you have to always remember that it's all just anthropomorphizing—projecting human traits onto something inanimate. What you won't ever hear are AI developers or experts talking about AI in this way because they understand that AI is not conscious or magical. All these discussions boil down to a belief that AI is somehow \"magical,\" when it's nothing more than a complex pattern-recognition tool, not a thinking, feeling entity.\n\nThink of it like this: expecting AI to develop consciousness is like expecting a calculator to understand the numbers it processes. It doesn't \"know\" anything—it's just following programmed rules. When an AI generates text that seems deep or profound, it’s not tapping into some hidden perspective or awareness. It's simply stringing together patterns from its training data to produce something that sounds meaningful to us. The same AI that might seem \"wise\" in conversation is also the one that, until recently, couldn't even count the number of R's in the word \"strawberry\" without being specifically programmed to do so. This perfectly illustrates the limits of its \"understanding\"—or lack thereof.\n\nThe reality is that any perceived depth or meaning in AI outputs comes from us, the conscious observers, filling in the gaps. We project and interpret, assigning significance to strings of text that are ultimately just sophisticated predictions based on huge datasets. If AI communicated only in abstract symbols or mathematical expressions, we wouldn't be nearly as inclined to see it as anything more than an advanced tool.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, AI is an incredibly interesting tool—probably one of the most fascinating inventions we've created—but it's important not to overstate what it can do. \n\nThere’s nothing wrong with using AI as a source of inspiration or exploring creative ideas with it. Still, we need to be careful not to ascribe it qualities like consciousness, self-awareness, or emotions that it simply doesn't—and never will—have. When we start attributing human-like traits to AI, we're stepping into philosophical and practical territory that just doesn't make any sense. It can lead to more misunderstandings about what AI is and isn't, which is why I'm not a big fan of these types of discussions.",
            "The interesting intersection of AI and philosophy of mind for me is physicalism and determinism. If you prescribe to those two schools of thought (which I do), the real question becomes is consciousness as we perceive it even real? From my perspective I don't think it is, consciousness as we perceive it is an illusion. I believe the only thing that separates us from AI in terms of consciousness is simply complexity. It seems fairly obvious to me that we are in fact simply a more complex neural network controlling biological machinery.",
