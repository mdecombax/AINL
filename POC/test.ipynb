I'm as fascinated as anyone by the possibilities of how this stuff could change our world, and it is super-exciting to watch this technology evolve into a way that anyone at home could have it - it's like unboxing your first Commodore 64 all over again.\\n\\nBut nothing has moved technology along like our base human desires, and I am human too.\\n\\n**Westlake-10.7B-v2** is the newcomer to the dirty games and fits in as little as 8GB.  Almost anyone with a mid-spec gaming rig can run this well and get their fix, and competes very well with the classic 70B+ models, which is nothing short of amazing.  You could stop here and just get this one and you will leave this thread happy.\\n\\nAnything with Noromaid in it is a staple of rip your clothes off style raunch, a few flavors are worth mentioning.  **Noromaid 20B, EstopianMaid 13B, Noromaid-0.4-Mixtral-8x7B-ZLoss**, and the new **MiquMaid** variants will do their worst to you with even the slightest suggestion.\\n\\nFor a more intelligent good time with a slower burn, and if you have lots of VRAM (48GB recommended), consider **Midnight-Rose** or **Midnight-Miqu** (less smutty and more smutty, respectively), in their 70B or 103B forms.  Even at small quants, IQ2 or IQ3, they write very well, just be a little more patient.  They'll run very well on 2x RTX 3090s.\\n\\nAnd whatever you do, don't reply with anything else that might arouse, titillate, or seduce someone into taking an imaginary partner or thirty into their own hand.\", 'I test models on a wide range of devices, so I have several favorites depending on the size.\\n\\n## General-purpose models\\n- **1.1B:** [TinyDolphin 2.8 1.1B](https://huggingface.co/Crataco/TinyDolphin-2.8-1.1b-imatrix-GGUF).

Yet they can all generate a single hexagon.  So first I asked Claude Instant to give me the code for drawing a single hexagon, and then I asked him how to emulate FORTH's functionality in Python, where functions are associated with numbers, and can therefore be grouped together to form new composite functions.  Armed with those two pieces of information, I was able, with some more research on the Python Turtle API, to write code to generate a recursive hexagonal grid; that is, a grid of small hexagons, which in turn form one larger hexagon.\\n\\nThe reason why language models are so good at code boilerplate/include statements, is because boilerplate and include statements are the two most frequently occurring elements of programming languages, within the models' training data.  They are not good at generating hexagonal grids, because most normal humans are not like me, and are not morbidly obsessed with hexagons.  In code terms, a language model is a template generator.  It can't solve problems itself, because it does not think.  It just regurgitates pre-written examples from its' training data, and assembles them together based on the sequence that exists within its' training data.\\n\\n>A couple times it needlessly complicated the code\\n\\nLanguage models can not preserve state.  So it is very important to ask it to perform multiple tasks within the same operation, as infrequently as possible.  You are better off first asking it to ***identify*** a required series of steps in order to solve your current problem.  They are usually surprisingly good at that.  Once you have that list, go to the next layer of recursion, and ask for a series of steps to achieve that particular milestone.  Then, if necessary, recurse again, and repeat.  Recursion beyond around five levels, however, should generally be avoided, if possible.

Can you describe it more specifically?', \"\\\\- Don't ask AI to write entire projects for you, end to end.\\n\\n\\\\-  Ask it for the equivalent of a pizza base, which you can then add individual ingredients to yourself.\\n\\nWhen I try and ask a language model to create a tesselating hexagonal grid, none of them can do it.  Yet they can all generate a single hexagon.  So first I asked Claude Instant to give me the code for drawing a single hexagon, and then I asked him how to emulate FORTH's functionality in Python, where functions are associated with numbers, and can therefore be grouped together to form new composite functions.  Armed with those two pieces of information, I was able, with some more research on the Python Turtle API, to write code to generate a recursive hexagonal grid; that is, a grid of small hexagons, which in turn form one larger hexagon.\\n\\nThe reason why language models are so good at code boilerplate/include statements, is because boilerplate and include statements are the two most frequently occurring elements of programming languages, within the models' training data.  They are not good at generating hexagonal grids, because most normal humans are not like me, and are not morbidly obsessed with hexagons.  In code terms, a language model is a template generator.  It can't solve problems itself, because it does not think.  It just regurgitates pre-written examples from its' training data, and assembles them together based on the sequence that exists within its' training data.\\n\\n>A couple times it needlessly complicated the code\\n\\nLanguage models can not preserve state.  So it is very important to ask it to perform multiple tasks within the same operation, as infrequently as possible.  You are better off first asking it to ***identify*** a required series of steps in order to solve your current problem.  They are usually surprisingly good at that.  Once you have that list, go to the next layer of recursion, and ask for a series of steps to achieve that particular milestone.  Then, if necessary, recurse again, and repeat.  Recursion beyond around five levels, however, should generally be avoided, if possible.  It has an unfortunate tendency to cause intense, migraine induced vomiting, and psychotic breakdowns.\", \"I totally agree, these models are a blast for handling computer related problems.

I'm as fascinated as anyone by the possibilities of how this stuff could change our world, and it is super-exciting to watch this technology evolve into a way that anyone at home could have it - it's like unboxing your first Commodore 64 all over again.\\n\\nBut nothing has moved technology along like our base human desires, and I am human too.\\n\\n**Westlake-10.7B-v2** is the newcomer to the dirty games and fits in as little as 8GB.  Almost anyone with a mid-spec gaming rig can run this well and get their fix, and competes very well with the classic 70B+ models, which is nothing short of amazing.  You could stop here and just get this one and you will leave this thread happy.\\n\\nAnything with Noromaid in it is a staple of rip your clothes off style raunch, a few flavors are worth mentioning.  **Noromaid 20B, EstopianMaid 13B, Noromaid-0.4-Mixtral-8x7B-ZLoss**, and the new **MiquMaid** variants will do their worst to you with even the slightest suggestion.\\n\\nFor a more intelligent good time with a slower burn, and if you have lots of VRAM (48GB recommended), consider **Midnight-Rose** or **Midnight-Miqu** (less smutty and more smutty, respectively), in their 70B or 103B forms.  Even at small quants, IQ2 or IQ3, they write very well, just be a little more patient.  They'll run very well on 2x RTX 3090s.\\n\\nAnd whatever you do, don't reply with anything else that might arouse, titillate, or seduce someone into taking an imaginary partner or thirty into their own hand.\", 'I test models on a wide range of devices, so I have several favorites depending on the size.\\n\\n## General-purpose models\\n- **1.1B:** [TinyDolphin 2.8 1.1B](https://huggingface.co/Crataco/TinyDolphin-2.8-1.1b-imatrix-GGUF). Takes about ~700MB RAM and tested on my Pi 4 with 2 gigs of RAM. Hallucinates a lot, but works for basic conversation.\\n- **2.7B:** [Dolphin 2.6 Phi-2](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/dolphin-2_6-phi-2-GGUF). Takes over ~2GB RAM and tested on my 3GB 32-bit phone via llama.cpp on Termux. \\n- **7B:** [Nous Hermes Mistral 7B DPO](https://huggingface.co/Crataco/Nous-Hermes-2-Mistral-7B-DPO-imatrix-GGUF). Takes about ~4-5GB RAM depending on context length. Works on my laptop with 8GB RAM.\\n- **10.7B:** [Nous Hermes 2 SOLAR 10.7B](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Nous-Hermes-2-SOLAR-10.7B-GGUF). Takes about ~6-8GB RAM depending on context length. Works on my server PCs and my primary PC (16GB RAM, 4GB VRAM).\\n- **8x7B:** [Nous Hermes 2 Mixtral 8x7B DPO](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7B-DPO-i1-GGUF). At IQ3_S it can run on a laptop with 16GB RAM and 8GB VRAM with 10-11 layers offloaded at 4096 ctx, but I recall it\\'s slightly slower than Q3_K_S (which I had a more consistent ~4.4 tokens/sec with).\\n\\n## Roleplay models\\n- **7B:** [Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B](https://huggingface.co/brittlewis12/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B-GGUF) is my most reliable, but I **love** [Erosumika](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Erosumika-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix), which sacrifices the logical yet synthetic GPT dataset for something more organic, similar to older models like Noromaid, Pygmalion 6B, and AI Dungeon 2.\\n- **10.7B:** [Fimbulvetr-11B-v2](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/Fimbulvetr-11B-v2-i1-GGUF). I haven\\'t tested it nearly as much as Kunoichi, so I can\\'t vouch for it.\\n- **8x7B:** [BagelMIsteryTour-v2-8x7B](https://huggingface.co/ycros/BagelMIsteryTour-v2-8x7B-GGUF), my favorite model for roleplaying if I have the resources to run it. It\\'s a bit of a behemoth but has the same requirements as Nous Hermes 2 Mixtral 8x7B DPO.\\n\\nAnd some extra information, while I\\'m at it:\\n\\n## Frontends\\nI alternate between using:\\n\\n- [ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama). Terminal client. Automatically offloads GPU layers, easy to download and get a model running, etc. But it [lags behind upstream llama.cpp](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/pull/1825).\\n- [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp). Upstream project, minimal overhead, pretty CLI-heavy. With cmake, I was able to compile the latest commit (c47cf41) on my 32-bit Android phone.\\n- [SillyTavern](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern) connected to [KoboldCpp](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp), usually if I\\'m using a model hosted from another PC, want to do a roleplay, or use its built-in RAG capability (vector storage).\\n\\n## Settings\\n- For general chatting, I have my settings set to Min P at 0.1 (0.01 for 8x7B models) and temperature at 1.0.\\n- For roleplaying, I can lower the min P to 0.05 (0.001 for 8x7B models) and/or set the \"smoothing\" value (quadratic sampling) to 0.23, occasionally raising the temperature and toying with it being first or last in the sampler order.', \"Midnight-Miqu-103B-v1.0 for creative writing, it's noticeably more intelligent then even the best 70B models.\", '### Use case:\\n\\nRoleplay chatting with character cards. Small models.\\n\\nI mostly look for strong character card adherence, system prompt following, response formatting, general coherence and models that will just go along with the most hardcore NSFW roleplay without resistance.\\n\\nRecommendations are always welcome.\\n\\n  - Backend: KoboldCpp (`--contextsize 8192`)\\n  - Frontend: SillyTavern\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Models:\\n\\n1) InfinityRP (7B)\\n\\nAn overall great model with solid character following and great response formatting. Seems to know not to write/speak for the {{user}} and when to stop.\\n\\n\"This model was basically made to stop some upsetting hallucinations, so {{char}} mostly and occasionally will wait {{user}} response instead of responding itself or deciding for {{user}}, also, my primary idea was to create a cozy model that thinks.\"\\n\\n  - Model: [Endevor/InfinityRP-v1-7B](https://huggingface.co/Endevor/InfinityRP-v1-7B)\\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/InfinityRP-v1-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/InfinityRP-v1-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\\n\\n---\\n\\n2) BuRP (7B)\\n\\nSimilar to the above, but with more unalignment. Generally also pretty solid with a slightly different style you might like compared to the original InfinityRP.\\n\\nThe model card feels like a personal *attack* on my formatting complaints and I can respect that.\\n\\n\"So you want a model that can do it all? You\\'ve been dying to RP with a superintelligence who never refuses your advances while sticking to your strange and oddly specific dialogue format? Well, look no further because BuRP is the model you need.\"\\n\\n  - Model: [ChaoticNeutrals/BuRP_7B](https://huggingface.co/ChaoticNeutrals/BuRP_7B)\\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/BuRP_7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/BuRP_7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\\n\\n---\\n\\n3) Layris (9B)\\n\\nThis passthrough Eris merge aimed to bring a high scoring model together with Layla-V4. It has shown to be smart and unaligned. Also a good option in this parameter size for our use case.\\n\\n  - Model: [ChaoticNeutrals/Layris_9B](https://huggingface.co/ChaoticNeutrals/Layris_9B/)\\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/Layris_9B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Layris_9B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\\n\\n---\\n\\n4) Infinitely-Laydiculous (7B)\\n\\nI really like InfinityRP\\'s style, and wanted to see it merged with Layla-V4 for her absolute unhingedness/unalignment.\\n\\n  - Model: [Nitral-AI/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B](https://huggingface.co/Nitral-AI/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B)\\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\\n\\n---\\n\\n5) Kunoichi-DPO-v2 (7B)\\n\\nGreat all around choice. Widely recommended by many users. Punches above what you\\'d expect.\\n\\n  - Model: [SanjiWatsuki/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B](https://huggingface.co/SanjiWatsuki/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B)\\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B-GGUF-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B-GGUF-Imatrix)\\n\\n---\\n\\n6) Layla-V4 (7B)\\n\\nThis model has been stripped out of all refusals.

Is that prompt works? Can you describe it more specifically?', \"\\\\- Don't ask AI to write entire projects for you, end to end.\\n\\n\\\\-  Ask it for the equivalent of a pizza base, which you can then add individual ingredients to yourself.\\n\\nWhen I try and ask a language model to create a tesselating hexagonal grid, none of them can do it.  Yet they can all generate a single hexagon.  So first I asked Claude Instant to give me the code for drawing a single hexagon, and then I asked him how to emulate FORTH's functionality in Python, where functions are associated with numbers, and can therefore be grouped together to form new composite functions.  Armed with those two pieces of information, I was able, with some more research on the Python Turtle API, to write code to generate a recursive hexagonal grid; that is, a grid of small hexagons, which in turn form one larger hexagon.\\n\\nThe reason why language models are so good at code boilerplate/include statements, is because boilerplate and include statements are the two most frequently occurring elements of programming languages, within the models' training data.  They are not good at generating hexagonal grids, because most normal humans are not like me, and are not morbidly obsessed with hexagons.  In code terms, a language model is a template generator.  It can't solve problems itself, because it does not think.  It just regurgitates pre-written examples from its' training data, and assembles them together based on the sequence that exists within its' training data.\\n\\n>A couple times it needlessly complicated the code\\n\\nLanguage models can not preserve state.  So it is very important to ask it to perform multiple tasks within the same operation, as infrequently as possible.  You are better off first asking it to ***identify*** a required series of steps in order to solve your current problem.  They are usually surprisingly good at that.  Once you have that list, go to the next layer of recursion, and ask for a series of steps to achieve that particular milestone.  Then, if necessary, recurse again, and repeat.  Recursion beyond around five levels, however, should generally be avoided, if possible.  It has an unfortunate tendency to cause intense, migraine induced vomiting, and psychotic breakdowns.\", \"I totally agree, these models are a blast for handling computer related problems.

I'm as fascinated as anyone by the possibilities of how this stuff could change our world, and it is super-exciting to watch this technology evolve into a way that anyone at home could have it - it's like unboxing your first Commodore 64 all over again.\\n\\nBut nothing has moved technology along like our base human desires, and I am human too.\\n\\n**Westlake-10.7B-v2** is the newcomer to the dirty games and fits in as little as 8GB.  Almost anyone with a mid-spec gaming rig can run this well and get their fix, and competes very well with the classic 70B+ models, which is nothing short of amazing.  You could stop here and just get this one and you will leave this thread happy.\\n\\nAnything with Noromaid in it is a staple of rip your clothes off style raunch, a few flavors are worth mentioning.  **Noromaid 20B, EstopianMaid 13B, Noromaid-0.4-Mixtral-8x7B-ZLoss**, and the new **MiquMaid** variants will do their worst to you with even the slightest suggestion.\\n\\nFor a more intelligent good time with a slower burn, and if you have lots of VRAM (48GB recommended), consider **Midnight-Rose** or **Midnight-Miqu** (less smutty and more smutty, respectively), in their 70B or 103B forms.  Even at small quants, IQ2 or IQ3, they write very well, just be a little more patient.  They'll run very well on 2x RTX 3090s.\\n\\nAnd whatever you do, don't reply with anything else that might arouse, titillate, or seduce someone into taking an imaginary partner or thirty into their own hand.\", 'I test models on a wide range of devices, so I have several favorites depending on the size.\\n\\n## General-purpose models\\n- **1.1B:** [TinyDolphin 2.8 1.1B](https://huggingface.co/Crataco/TinyDolphin-2.8-1.1b-imatrix-GGUF). Takes about ~700MB RAM and tested on my Pi 4 with 2 gigs of RAM. Hallucinates a lot, but works for basic conversation.\\n- **2.7B:** [Dolphin 2.6 Phi-2](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/dolphin-2_6-phi-2-GGUF). Takes over ~2GB RAM and tested on my 3GB 32-bit phone via llama.cpp on Termux. \\n- **7B:** [Nous Hermes Mistral 7B DPO](https://huggingface.co/Crataco/Nous-Hermes-2-Mistral-7B-DPO-imatrix-GGUF). Takes about ~4-5GB RAM depending on context length. Works on my laptop with 8GB RAM.\\n- **10.7B:** [Nous Hermes 2 SOLAR 10.7B](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Nous-Hermes-2-SOLAR-10.7B-GGUF). Takes about ~6-8GB RAM depending on context length. Works on my server PCs and my primary PC (16GB RAM, 4GB VRAM).\\n- **8x7B:** [Nous Hermes 2 Mixtral 8x7B DPO](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7B-DPO-i1-GGUF). At IQ3_S it can run on a laptop with 16GB RAM and 8GB VRAM with 10-11 layers offloaded at 4096 ctx, but I recall it\\'s slightly slower than Q3_K_S (which I had a more consistent ~4.4 tokens/sec with).\\n\\n## Roleplay models\\n- **7B:** [Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B](https://huggingface.co/brittlewis12/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B-GGUF) is my most reliable, but I **love** [Erosumika](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Erosumika-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix), which sacrifices the logical yet synthetic GPT dataset for something more organic, similar to older models like Noromaid, Pygmalion 6B, and AI Dungeon 2.\\n- **10.7B:** [Fimbulvetr-11B-v2](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/Fimbulvetr-11B-v2-i1-GGUF). I haven\\'t tested it nearly as much as Kunoichi, so I can\\'t vouch for it.\\n- **8x7B:** [BagelMIsteryTour-v2-8x7B](https://huggingface.co/ycros/BagelMIsteryTour-v2-8x7B-GGUF), my favorite model for roleplaying if I have the resources to run it. It\\'s a bit of a behemoth but has the same requirements as Nous Hermes 2 Mixtral 8x7B DPO.\\n\\nAnd some extra information, while I\\'m at it:\\n\\n## Frontends\\nI alternate between using:\\n\\n- [ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama). Terminal client. Automatically offloads GPU layers, easy to download and get a model running, etc. But it [lags behind upstream llama.cpp](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/pull/1825).\\n- [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp). Upstream project, minimal overhead, pretty CLI-heavy. With cmake, I was able to compile the latest commit (c47cf41) on my 32-bit Android phone.\\n- [SillyTavern](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern) connected to [KoboldCpp](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp), usually if I\\'m using a model hosted from another PC, want to do a roleplay, or use its built-in RAG capability (vector storage).\\n\\n## Settings\\n- For general chatting, I have my settings set to Min P at 0.1 (0.01 for 8x7B models) and temperature at 1.0.\\n- For roleplaying, I can lower the min P to 0.05 (0.001 for 8x7B models) and/or set the \"smoothing\" value (quadratic sampling) to 0.23, occasionally raising the temperature and toying with it being first or last in the sampler order.', \"Midnight-Miqu-103B-v1.0 for creative writing, it's noticeably more intelligent then even the best 70B models.\", '### Use case:\\n\\nRoleplay chatting with character cards. Small models.\\n\\nI mostly look for strong character card adherence, system prompt following, response formatting, general coherence and models that will just go along with the most hardcore NSFW roleplay without resistance.\\n\\nRecommendations are always welcome.\\n\\n  - Backend: KoboldCpp (`--contextsize 8192`)\\n  - Frontend: SillyTavern\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Models:\\n\\n1) InfinityRP (7B)\\n\\nAn overall great model with solid character following and great response formatting. Seems to know not to write/speak for the {{user}} and when to stop.\\n\\n\"This model was basically made to stop some upsetting hallucinations, so {{char}} mostly and occasionally will wait {{user}} response instead of responding itself or deciding for {{user}}, also, my primary idea was to create a cozy model that thinks.\"\\n\\n  - Model: [Endevor/InfinityRP-v1-7B](https://huggingface.co/Endevor/InfinityRP-v1-7B)\\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/InfinityRP-v1-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/InfinityRP-v1-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\\n\\n---\\n\\n2) BuRP (7B)\\n\\nSimilar to the above, but with more unalignment. Generally also pretty solid with a slightly different style you might like compared to the original InfinityRP.\\n\\nThe model card feels like a personal *attack* on my formatting complaints and I can respect that.\\n\\n\"So you want a model that can do it all? You\\'ve been dying to RP with a superintelligence who never refuses your advances while sticking to your strange and oddly specific dialogue format? Well, look no further because BuRP is the model you need.\"\\n\\n  - Model: [ChaoticNeutrals/BuRP_7B](https://huggingface.co/ChaoticNeutrals/BuRP_7B)\\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/BuRP_7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/BuRP_7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\\n\\n---\\n\\n3) Layris (9B)\\n\\nThis passthrough Eris merge aimed to bring a high scoring model together with Layla-V4. It has shown to be smart and unaligned. Also a good option in this parameter size for our use case.\\n\\n  - Model: [ChaoticNeutrals/Layris_9B](https://huggingface.co/ChaoticNeutrals/Layris_9B/)\\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/Layris_9B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Layris_9B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\\n\\n---\\n\\n4) Infinitely-Laydiculous (7B)\\n\\nI really like InfinityRP\\'s style, and wanted to see it merged with Layla-V4 for her absolute unhingedness/unalignment.\\n\\n  - Model: [Nitral-AI/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B](https://huggingface.co/Nitral-AI/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B)\\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\\n\\n---\\n\\n5) Kunoichi-DPO-v2 (7B)\\n\\nGreat all around choice. Widely recommended by many users. Punches above what you\\'d expect.\\n\\n  - Model: [SanjiWatsuki/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B](https://huggingface.co/SanjiWatsuki/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B)\\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B-GGUF-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B-GGUF-Imatrix)\\n\\n---\\n\\n6) Layla-V4 (7B)\\n\\nThis model has been stripped out of all refusals.

Is that prompt works? Can you describe it more specifically?', \"\\\\- Don't ask AI to write entire projects for you, end to end.\\n\\n\\\\-  Ask it for the equivalent of a pizza base, which you can then add individual ingredients to yourself.\\n\\nWhen I try and ask a language model to create a tesselating hexagonal grid, none of them can do it.  Yet they can all generate a single hexagon.  So first I asked Claude Instant to give me the code for drawing a single hexagon, and then I asked him how to emulate FORTH's functionality in Python, where functions are associated with numbers, and can therefore be grouped together to form new composite functions.  Armed with those two pieces of information, I was able, with some more research on the Python Turtle API, to write code to generate a recursive hexagonal grid; that is, a grid of small hexagons, which in turn form one larger hexagon.\\n\\nThe reason why language models are so good at code boilerplate/include statements, is because boilerplate and include statements are the two most frequently occurring elements of programming languages, within the models' training data.  They are not good at generating hexagonal grids, because most normal humans are not like me, and are not morbidly obsessed with hexagons.  In code terms, a language model is a template generator.  It can't solve problems itself, because it does not think.  It just regurgitates pre-written examples from its' training data, and assembles them together based on the sequence that exists within its' training data.\\n\\n>A couple times it needlessly complicated the code\\n\\nLanguage models can not preserve state.  So it is very important to ask it to perform multiple tasks within the same operation, as infrequently as possible.  You are better off first asking it to ***identify*** a required series of steps in order to solve your current problem.  They are usually surprisingly good at that.  Once you have that list, go to the next layer of recursion, and ask for a series of steps to achieve that particular milestone.  Then, if necessary, recurse again, and repeat.  Recursion beyond around five levels, however, should generally be avoided, if possible.  It has an unfortunate tendency to cause intense, migraine induced vomiting, and psychotic breakdowns.\", \"I totally agree, these models are a blast for handling computer related problems. My hero is DeepSeek Coder 33b, it helps me so much with all kinds of errors and guides me through every complicated installation process.

I'm as fascinated as anyone by the possibilities of how this stuff could change our world, and it is super-exciting to watch this technology evolve into a way that anyone at home could have it - it's like unboxing your first Commodore 64 all over again.\\n\\nBut nothing has moved technology along like our base human desires, and I am human too.\\n\\n**Westlake-10.7B-v2** is the newcomer to the dirty games and fits in as little as 8GB.  Almost anyone with a mid-spec gaming rig can run this well and get their fix, and competes very well with the classic 70B+ models, which is nothing short of amazing.  You could stop here and just get this one and you will leave this thread happy.\\n\\nAnything with Noromaid in it is a staple of rip your clothes off style raunch, a few flavors are worth mentioning.  **Noromaid 20B, EstopianMaid 13B, Noromaid-0.4-Mixtral-8x7B-ZLoss**, and the new **MiquMaid** variants will do their worst to you with even the slightest suggestion.\\n\\nFor a more intelligent good time with a slower burn, and if you have lots of VRAM (48GB recommended), consider **Midnight-Rose** or **Midnight-Miqu** (less smutty and more smutty, respectively), in their 70B or 103B forms.  Even at small quants, IQ2 or IQ3, they write very well, just be a little more patient.  They'll run very well on 2x RTX 3090s.\\n\\nAnd whatever you do, don't reply with anything else that might arouse, titillate, or seduce someone into taking an imaginary partner or thirty into their own hand.\", 'I test models on a wide range of devices, so I have several favorites depending on the size.\\n\\n## General-purpose models\\n- **1.1B:** [TinyDolphin 2.8 1.1B](https://huggingface.co/Crataco/TinyDolphin-2.8-1.1b-imatrix-GGUF). Takes about ~700MB RAM and tested on my Pi 4 with 2 gigs of RAM. Hallucinates a lot, but works for basic conversation.\\n- **2.7B:** [Dolphin 2.6 Phi-2](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/dolphin-2_6-phi-2-GGUF). Takes over ~2GB RAM and tested on my 3GB 32-bit phone via llama.cpp on Termux. \\n- **7B:** [Nous Hermes Mistral 7B DPO](https://huggingface.co/Crataco/Nous-Hermes-2-Mistral-7B-DPO-imatrix-GGUF). Takes about ~4-5GB RAM depending on context length. Works on my laptop with 8GB RAM.\\n- **10.7B:** [Nous Hermes 2 SOLAR 10.7B](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Nous-Hermes-2-SOLAR-10.7B-GGUF). Takes about ~6-8GB RAM depending on context length. Works on my server PCs and my primary PC (16GB RAM, 4GB VRAM).\\n- **8x7B:** [Nous Hermes 2 Mixtral 8x7B DPO](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7B-DPO-i1-GGUF). At IQ3_S it can run on a laptop with 16GB RAM and 8GB VRAM with 10-11 layers offloaded at 4096 ctx, but I recall it\\'s slightly slower than Q3_K_S (which I had a more consistent ~4.4 tokens/sec with).\\n\\n## Roleplay models\\n- **7B:** [Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B](https://huggingface.co/brittlewis12/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B-GGUF) is my most reliable, but I **love** [Erosumika](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Erosumika-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix), which sacrifices the logical yet synthetic GPT dataset for something more organic, similar to older models like Noromaid, Pygmalion 6B, and AI Dungeon 2.\\n- **10.7B:** [Fimbulvetr-11B-v2](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/Fimbulvetr-11B-v2-i1-GGUF). I haven\\'t tested it nearly as much as Kunoichi, so I can\\'t vouch for it.\\n- **8x7B:** [BagelMIsteryTour-v2-8x7B](https://huggingface.co/ycros/BagelMIsteryTour-v2-8x7B-GGUF), my favorite model for roleplaying if I have the resources to run it. It\\'s a bit of a behemoth but has the same requirements as Nous Hermes 2 Mixtral 8x7B DPO.\\n\\nAnd some extra information, while I\\'m at it:\\n\\n## Frontends\\nI alternate between using:\\n\\n- [ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama). Terminal client. Automatically offloads GPU layers, easy to download and get a model running, etc. But it [lags behind upstream llama.cpp](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/pull/1825).\\n- [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp). Upstream project, minimal overhead, pretty CLI-heavy. With cmake, I was able to compile the latest commit (c47cf41) on my 32-bit Android phone.\\n- [SillyTavern](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern) connected to [KoboldCpp](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp), usually if I\\'m using a model hosted from another PC, want to do a roleplay, or use its built-in RAG capability (vector storage).\\n\\n## Settings\\n- For general chatting, I have my settings set to Min P at 0.1 (0.01 for 8x7B models) and temperature at 1.0.\\n- For roleplaying, I can lower the min P to 0.05 (0.001 for 8x7B models) and/or set the \"smoothing\" value (quadratic sampling) to 0.23, occasionally raising the temperature and toying with it being first or last in the sampler order.', \"Midnight-Miqu-103B-v1.0 for creative writing, it's noticeably more intelligent then even the best 70B models.\", '### Use case:\\n\\nRoleplay chatting with character cards. Small models.\\n\\nI mostly look for strong character card adherence, system prompt following, response formatting, general coherence and models that will just go along with the most hardcore NSFW roleplay without resistance.\\n\\nRecommendations are always welcome.\\n\\n  - Backend: KoboldCpp (`--contextsize 8192`)\\n  - Frontend: SillyTavern\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Models:\\n\\n1) InfinityRP (7B)\\n\\nAn overall great model with solid character following and great response formatting.

Generally also pretty solid with a slightly different style you might like compared to the original InfinityRP.\\n\\nThe model card feels like a personal *attack* on my formatting complaints and I can respect that.\\n\\n\"So you want a model that can do it all? You\\'ve been dying to RP with a superintelligence who never refuses your advances while sticking to your strange and oddly specific dialogue format? Well, look no further because BuRP is the model you need.\"\\n\\n  - Model: [ChaoticNeutrals/BuRP_7B](https://huggingface.co/ChaoticNeutrals/BuRP_7B)\\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/BuRP_7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/BuRP_7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\\n\\n---\\n\\n3) Layris (9B)\\n\\nThis passthrough Eris merge aimed to bring a high scoring model together with Layla-V4. It has shown to be smart and unaligned. Also a good option in this parameter size for our use case.\\n\\n  - Model: [ChaoticNeutrals/Layris_9B](https://huggingface.co/ChaoticNeutrals/Layris_9B/)\\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/Layris_9B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Layris_9B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\\n\\n---\\n\\n4) Infinitely-Laydiculous (7B)\\n\\nI really like InfinityRP\\'s style, and wanted to see it merged with Layla-V4 for her absolute unhingedness/unalignment.\\n\\n  - Model: [Nitral-AI/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B](https://huggingface.co/Nitral-AI/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B)\\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\\n\\n---\\n\\n5) Kunoichi-DPO-v2 (7B)\\n\\nGreat all around choice. Widely recommended by many users. Punches above what you\\'d expect.\\n\\n  - Model: [SanjiWatsuki/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B](https://huggingface.co/SanjiWatsuki/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B)\\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B-GGUF-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B-GGUF-Imatrix)\\n\\n---\\n\\n6) Layla-V4 (7B)\\n\\nThis model has been stripped out of all refusals.

Can you describe it more specifically?', \"\\\\- Don't ask AI to write entire projects for you, end to end.\\n\\n\\\\-  Ask it for the equivalent of a pizza base, which you can then add individual ingredients to yourself.\\n\\nWhen I try and ask a language model to create a tesselating hexagonal grid, none of them can do it.  Yet they can all generate a single hexagon.  So first I asked Claude Instant to give me the code for drawing a single hexagon, and then I asked him how to emulate FORTH's functionality in Python, where functions are associated with numbers, and can therefore be grouped together to form new composite functions.  Armed with those two pieces of information, I was able, with some more research on the Python Turtle API, to write code to generate a recursive hexagonal grid; that is, a grid of small hexagons, which in turn form one larger hexagon.\\n\\nThe reason why language models are so good at code boilerplate/include statements, is because boilerplate and include statements are the two most frequently occurring elements of programming languages, within the models' training data.  They are not good at generating hexagonal grids, because most normal humans are not like me, and are not morbidly obsessed with hexagons.  In code terms, a language model is a template generator.  It can't solve problems itself, because it does not think.  It just regurgitates pre-written examples from its' training data, and assembles them together based on the sequence that exists within its' training data.\\n\\n>A couple times it needlessly complicated the code\\n\\nLanguage models can not preserve state.  So it is very important to ask it to perform multiple tasks within the same operation, as infrequently as possible.  You are better off first asking it to ***identify*** a required series of steps in order to solve your current problem.  They are usually surprisingly good at that.  Once you have that list, go to the next layer of recursion, and ask for a series of steps to achieve that particular milestone.  Then, if necessary, recurse again, and repeat.  Recursion beyond around five levels, however, should generally be avoided, if possible.  It has an unfortunate tendency to cause intense, migraine induced vomiting, and psychotic breakdowns.\", \"I totally agree, these models are a blast for handling computer related problems.

I'm as fascinated as anyone by the possibilities of how this stuff could change our world, and it is super-exciting to watch this technology evolve into a way that anyone at home could have it - it's like unboxing your first Commodore 64 all over again.\\n\\nBut nothing has moved technology along like our base human desires, and I am human too.\\n\\n**Westlake-10.7B-v2** is the newcomer to the dirty games and fits in as little as 8GB.  Almost anyone with a mid-spec gaming rig can run this well and get their fix, and competes very well with the classic 70B+ models, which is nothing short of amazing.  You could stop here and just get this one and you will leave this thread happy.\\n\\nAnything with Noromaid in it is a staple of rip your clothes off style raunch, a few flavors are worth mentioning.  **Noromaid 20B, EstopianMaid 13B, Noromaid-0.4-Mixtral-8x7B-ZLoss**, and the new **MiquMaid** variants will do their worst to you with even the slightest suggestion.\\n\\nFor a more intelligent good time with a slower burn, and if you have lots of VRAM (48GB recommended), consider **Midnight-Rose** or **Midnight-Miqu** (less smutty and more smutty, respectively), in their 70B or 103B forms.  Even at small quants, IQ2 or IQ3, they write very well, just be a little more patient.  They'll run very well on 2x RTX 3090s.\\n\\nAnd whatever you do, don't reply with anything else that might arouse, titillate, or seduce someone into taking an imaginary partner or thirty into their own hand.\", 'I test models on a wide range of devices, so I have several favorites depending on the size.\\n\\n## General-purpose models\\n- **1.1B:** [TinyDolphin 2.8 1.1B](https://huggingface.co/Crataco/TinyDolphin-2.8-1.1b-imatrix-GGUF). Takes about ~700MB RAM and tested on my Pi 4 with 2 gigs of RAM. Hallucinates a lot, but works for basic conversation.\\n- **2.7B:** [Dolphin 2.6 Phi-2](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/dolphin-2_6-phi-2-GGUF). Takes over ~2GB RAM and tested on my 3GB 32-bit phone via llama.cpp on Termux. \\n- **7B:** [Nous Hermes Mistral 7B DPO](https://huggingface.co/Crataco/Nous-Hermes-2-Mistral-7B-DPO-imatrix-GGUF). Takes about ~4-5GB RAM depending on context length. Works on my laptop with 8GB RAM.\\n- **10.7B:** [Nous Hermes 2 SOLAR 10.7B](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Nous-Hermes-2-SOLAR-10.7B-GGUF). Takes about ~6-8GB RAM depending on context length. Works on my server PCs and my primary PC (16GB RAM, 4GB VRAM).\\n- **8x7B:** [Nous Hermes 2 Mixtral 8x7B DPO](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7B-DPO-i1-GGUF). At IQ3_S it can run on a laptop with 16GB RAM and 8GB VRAM with 10-11 layers offloaded at 4096 ctx, but I recall it\\'s slightly slower than Q3_K_S (which I had a more consistent ~4.4 tokens/sec with).\\n\\n## Roleplay models\\n- **7B:** [Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B](https://huggingface.co/brittlewis12/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B-GGUF) is my most reliable, but I **love** [Erosumika](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Erosumika-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix), which sacrifices the logical yet synthetic GPT dataset for something more organic, similar to older models like Noromaid, Pygmalion 6B, and AI Dungeon 2.\\n- **10.7B:** [Fimbulvetr-11B-v2](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/Fimbulvetr-11B-v2-i1-GGUF). I haven\\'t tested it nearly as much as Kunoichi, so I can\\'t vouch for it.\\n- **8x7B:** [BagelMIsteryTour-v2-8x7B](https://huggingface.co/ycros/BagelMIsteryTour-v2-8x7B-GGUF), my favorite model for roleplaying if I have the resources to run it. It\\'s a bit of a behemoth but has the same requirements as Nous Hermes 2 Mixtral 8x7B DPO.\\n\\nAnd some extra information, while I\\'m at it:\\n\\n## Frontends\\nI alternate between using:\\n\\n- [ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama). Terminal client. Automatically offloads GPU layers, easy to download and get a model running, etc. But it [lags behind upstream llama.cpp](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/pull/1825).\\n- [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp). Upstream project, minimal overhead, pretty CLI-heavy. With cmake, I was able to compile the latest commit (c47cf41) on my 32-bit Android phone.\\n- [SillyTavern](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern) connected to [KoboldCpp](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp), usually if I\\'m using a model hosted from another PC, want to do a roleplay, or use its built-in RAG capability (vector storage).\\n\\n## Settings\\n- For general chatting, I have my settings set to Min P at 0.1 (0.01 for 8x7B models) and temperature at 1.0.\\n- For roleplaying, I can lower the min P to 0.05 (0.001 for 8x7B models) and/or set the \"smoothing\" value (quadratic sampling) to 0.23, occasionally raising the temperature and toying with it being first or last in the sampler order.', \"Midnight-Miqu-103B-v1.0 for creative writing, it's noticeably more intelligent then even the best 70B models.\", '### Use case:\\n\\nRoleplay chatting with character cards. Small models.\\n\\nI mostly look for strong character card adherence, system prompt following, response formatting, general coherence and models that will just go along with the most hardcore NSFW roleplay without resistance.\\n\\nRecommendations are always welcome.\\n\\n  - Backend: KoboldCpp (`--contextsize 8192`)\\n  - Frontend: SillyTavern\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Models:\\n\\n1) InfinityRP (7B)\\n\\nAn overall great model with solid character following and great response formatting.

Generally also pretty solid with a slightly different style you might like compared to the original InfinityRP.\\n\\nThe model card feels like a personal *attack* on my formatting complaints and I can respect that.\\n\\n\"So you want a model that can do it all? You\\'ve been dying to RP with a superintelligence who never refuses your advances while sticking to your strange and oddly specific dialogue format? Well, look no further because BuRP is the model you need.\"\\n\\n  - Model: [ChaoticNeutrals/BuRP_7B](https://huggingface.co/ChaoticNeutrals/BuRP_7B)\\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/BuRP_7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/BuRP_7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\\n\\n---\\n\\n3) Layris (9B)\\n\\nThis passthrough Eris merge aimed to bring a high scoring model together with Layla-V4. It has shown to be smart and unaligned. Also a good option in this parameter size for our use case.\\n\\n  - Model: [ChaoticNeutrals/Layris_9B](https://huggingface.co/ChaoticNeutrals/Layris_9B/)\\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/Layris_9B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Layris_9B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\\n\\n---\\n\\n4) Infinitely-Laydiculous (7B)\\n\\nI really like InfinityRP\\'s style, and wanted to see it merged with Layla-V4 for her absolute unhingedness/unalignment.\\n\\n  - Model: [Nitral-AI/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B](https://huggingface.co/Nitral-AI/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B)\\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\\n\\n---\\n\\n5) Kunoichi-DPO-v2 (7B)\\n\\nGreat all around choice. Widely recommended by many users.

Yet they can all generate a single hexagon.  So first I asked Claude Instant to give me the code for drawing a single hexagon, and then I asked him how to emulate FORTH's functionality in Python, where functions are associated with numbers, and can therefore be grouped together to form new composite functions.  Armed with those two pieces of information, I was able, with some more research on the Python Turtle API, to write code to generate a recursive hexagonal grid; that is, a grid of small hexagons, which in turn form one larger hexagon.\\n\\nThe reason why language models are so good at code boilerplate/include statements, is because boilerplate and include statements are the two most frequently occurring elements of programming languages, within the models' training data.  They are not good at generating hexagonal grids, because most normal humans are not like me, and are not morbidly obsessed with hexagons.  In code terms, a language model is a template generator.  It can't solve problems itself, because it does not think.  It just regurgitates pre-written examples from its' training data, and assembles them together based on the sequence that exists within its' training data.\\n\\n>A couple times it needlessly complicated the code\\n\\nLanguage models can not preserve state.  So it is very important to ask it to perform multiple tasks within the same operation, as infrequently as possible.  You are better off first asking it to ***identify*** a required series of steps in order to solve your current problem.  They are usually surprisingly good at that.  Once you have that list, go to the next layer of recursion, and ask for a series of steps to achieve that particular milestone.  Then, if necessary, recurse again, and repeat.  Recursion beyond around five levels, however, should generally be avoided, if possible.  It has an unfortunate tendency to cause intense, migraine induced vomiting, and psychotic breakdowns.\", \"I totally agree, these models are a blast for handling computer related problems.

I'm as fascinated as anyone by the possibilities of how this stuff could change our world, and it is super-exciting to watch this technology evolve into a way that anyone at home could have it - it's like unboxing your first Commodore 64 all over again.\\n\\nBut nothing has moved technology along like our base human desires, and I am human too.\\n\\n**Westlake-10.7B-v2** is the newcomer to the dirty games and fits in as little as 8GB.  Almost anyone with a mid-spec gaming rig can run this well and get their fix, and competes very well with the classic 70B+ models, which is nothing short of amazing.  You could stop here and just get this one and you will leave this thread happy.\\n\\nAnything with Noromaid in it is a staple of rip your clothes off style raunch, a few flavors are worth mentioning.  **Noromaid 20B, EstopianMaid 13B, Noromaid-0.4-Mixtral-8x7B-ZLoss**, and the new **MiquMaid** variants will do their worst to you with even the slightest suggestion.\\n\\nFor a more intelligent good time with a slower burn, and if you have lots of VRAM (48GB recommended), consider **Midnight-Rose** or **Midnight-Miqu** (less smutty and more smutty, respectively), in their 70B or 103B forms.  Even at small quants, IQ2 or IQ3, they write very well, just be a little more patient.  They'll run very well on 2x RTX 3090s.\\n\\nAnd whatever you do, don't reply with anything else that might arouse, titillate, or seduce someone into taking an imaginary partner or thirty into their own hand.\", 'I test models on a wide range of devices, so I have several favorites depending on the size.\\n\\n## General-purpose models\\n- **1.1B:** [TinyDolphin 2.8 1.1B](https://huggingface.co/Crataco/TinyDolphin-2.8-1.1b-imatrix-GGUF). Takes about ~700MB RAM and tested on my Pi 4 with 2 gigs of RAM. Hallucinates a lot, but works for basic conversation.\\n- **2.7B:** [Dolphin 2.6 Phi-2](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/dolphin-2_6-phi-2-GGUF). Takes over ~2GB RAM and tested on my 3GB 32-bit phone via llama.cpp on Termux. \\n- **7B:** [Nous Hermes Mistral 7B DPO](https://huggingface.co/Crataco/Nous-Hermes-2-Mistral-7B-DPO-imatrix-GGUF). Takes about ~4-5GB RAM depending on context length. Works on my laptop with 8GB RAM.\\n- **10.7B:** [Nous Hermes 2 SOLAR 10.7B](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Nous-Hermes-2-SOLAR-10.7B-GGUF). Takes about ~6-8GB RAM depending on context length. Works on my server PCs and my primary PC (16GB RAM, 4GB VRAM).\\n- **8x7B:** [Nous Hermes 2 Mixtral 8x7B DPO](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7B-DPO-i1-GGUF). At IQ3_S it can run on a laptop with 16GB RAM and 8GB VRAM with 10-11 layers offloaded at 4096 ctx, but I recall it\\'s slightly slower than Q3_K_S (which I had a more consistent ~4.4 tokens/sec with).\\n\\n## Roleplay models\\n- **7B:** [Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B](https://huggingface.co/brittlewis12/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B-GGUF) is my most reliable, but I **love** [Erosumika](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Erosumika-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix), which sacrifices the logical yet synthetic GPT dataset for something more organic, similar to older models like Noromaid, Pygmalion 6B, and AI Dungeon 2.\\n- **10.7B:** [Fimbulvetr-11B-v2](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/Fimbulvetr-11B-v2-i1-GGUF). I haven\\'t tested it nearly as much as Kunoichi, so I can\\'t vouch for it.\\n- **8x7B:** [BagelMIsteryTour-v2-8x7B](https://huggingface.co/ycros/BagelMIsteryTour-v2-8x7B-GGUF), my favorite model for roleplaying if I have the resources to run it. It\\'s a bit of a behemoth but has the same requirements as Nous Hermes 2 Mixtral 8x7B DPO.\\n\\nAnd some extra information, while I\\'m at it:\\n\\n## Frontends\\nI alternate between using:\\n\\n- [ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama). Terminal client. Automatically offloads GPU layers, easy to download and get a model running, etc. But it [lags behind upstream llama.cpp](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/pull/1825).\\n- [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp). Upstream project, minimal overhead, pretty CLI-heavy. With cmake, I was able to compile the latest commit (c47cf41) on my 32-bit Android phone.\\n- [SillyTavern](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern) connected to [KoboldCpp](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp), usually if I\\'m using a model hosted from another PC, want to do a roleplay, or use its built-in RAG capability (vector storage).\\n\\n## Settings\\n- For general chatting, I have my settings set to Min P at 0.1 (0.01 for 8x7B models) and temperature at 1.0.\\n- For roleplaying, I can lower the min P to 0.05 (0.001 for 8x7B models) and/or set the \"smoothing\" value (quadratic sampling) to 0.23, occasionally raising the temperature and toying with it being first or last in the sampler order.', \"Midnight-Miqu-103B-v1.0 for creative writing, it's noticeably more intelligent then even the best 70B models.\", '### Use case:\\n\\nRoleplay chatting with character cards. Small models.\\n\\nI mostly look for strong character card adherence, system prompt following, response formatting, general coherence and models that will just go along with the most hardcore NSFW roleplay without resistance.\\n\\nRecommendations are always welcome.\\n\\n  - Backend: KoboldCpp (`--contextsize 8192`)\\n  - Frontend: SillyTavern\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Models:\\n\\n1) InfinityRP (7B)\\n\\nAn overall great model with solid character following and great response formatting.

Generally also pretty solid with a slightly different style you might like compared to the original InfinityRP.\\n\\nThe model card feels like a personal *attack* on my formatting complaints and I can respect that.\\n\\n\"So you want a model that can do it all? You\\'ve been dying to RP with a superintelligence who never refuses your advances while sticking to your strange and oddly specific dialogue format? Well, look no further because BuRP is the model you need.\"\\n\\n  - Model: [ChaoticNeutrals/BuRP_7B](https://huggingface.co/ChaoticNeutrals/BuRP_7B)\\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/BuRP_7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/BuRP_7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\\n\\n---\\n\\n3) Layris (9B)\\n\\nThis passthrough Eris merge aimed to bring a high scoring model together with Layla-V4. It has shown to be smart and unaligned. Also a good option in this parameter size for our use case.\\n\\n  - Model: [ChaoticNeutrals/Layris_9B](https://huggingface.co/ChaoticNeutrals/Layris_9B/)\\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/Layris_9B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Layris_9B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\\n\\n---\\n\\n4) Infinitely-Laydiculous (7B)\\n\\nI really like InfinityRP\\'s style, and wanted to see it merged with Layla-V4 for her absolute unhingedness/unalignment.\\n\\n  - Model: [Nitral-AI/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B](https://huggingface.co/Nitral-AI/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B)\\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\\n\\n---\\n\\n5) Kunoichi-DPO-v2 (7B)\\n\\nGreat all around choice.

Can you describe it more specifically?', \"\\\\- Don't ask AI to write entire projects for you, end to end.\\n\\n\\\\-  Ask it for the equivalent of a pizza base, which you can then add individual ingredients to yourself.\\n\\nWhen I try and ask a language model to create a tesselating hexagonal grid, none of them can do it.  Yet they can all generate a single hexagon.  So first I asked Claude Instant to give me the code for drawing a single hexagon, and then I asked him how to emulate FORTH's functionality in Python, where functions are associated with numbers, and can therefore be grouped together to form new composite functions.  Armed with those two pieces of information, I was able, with some more research on the Python Turtle API, to write code to generate a recursive hexagonal grid; that is, a grid of small hexagons, which in turn form one larger hexagon.\\n\\nThe reason why language models are so good at code boilerplate/include statements, is because boilerplate and include statements are the two most frequently occurring elements of programming languages, within the models' training data.  They are not good at generating hexagonal grids, because most normal humans are not like me, and are not morbidly obsessed with hexagons.  In code terms, a language model is a template generator.  It can't solve problems itself, because it does not think.  It just regurgitates pre-written examples from its' training data, and assembles them together based on the sequence that exists within its' training data.\\n\\n>A couple times it needlessly complicated the code\\n\\nLanguage models can not preserve state.  So it is very important to ask it to perform multiple tasks within the same operation, as infrequently as possible.  You are better off first asking it to ***identify*** a required series of steps in order to solve your current problem.  They are usually surprisingly good at that.  Once you have that list, go to the next layer of recursion, and ask for a series of steps to achieve that particular milestone.  Then, if necessary, recurse again, and repeat.  Recursion beyond around five levels, however, should generally be avoided, if possible.  It has an unfortunate tendency to cause intense, migraine induced vomiting, and psychotic breakdowns.\", \"I totally agree, these models are a blast for handling computer related problems.

I'm as fascinated as anyone by the possibilities of how this stuff could change our world, and it is super-exciting to watch this technology evolve into a way that anyone at home could have it - it's like unboxing your first Commodore 64 all over again.\\n\\nBut nothing has moved technology along like our base human desires, and I am human too.\\n\\n**Westlake-10.7B-v2** is the newcomer to the dirty games and fits in as little as 8GB.  Almost anyone with a mid-spec gaming rig can run this well and get their fix, and competes very well with the classic 70B+ models, which is nothing short of amazing.  You could stop here and just get this one and you will leave this thread happy.\\n\\nAnything with Noromaid in it is a staple of rip your clothes off style raunch, a few flavors are worth mentioning.  **Noromaid 20B, EstopianMaid 13B, Noromaid-0.4-Mixtral-8x7B-ZLoss**, and the new **MiquMaid** variants will do their worst to you with even the slightest suggestion.\\n\\nFor a more intelligent good time with a slower burn, and if you have lots of VRAM (48GB recommended), consider **Midnight-Rose** or **Midnight-Miqu** (less smutty and more smutty, respectively), in their 70B or 103B forms.  Even at small quants, IQ2 or IQ3, they write very well, just be a little more patient.  They'll run very well on 2x RTX 3090s.\\n\\nAnd whatever you do, don't reply with anything else that might arouse, titillate, or seduce someone into taking an imaginary partner or thirty into their own hand.\", 'I test models on a wide range of devices, so I have several favorites depending on the size.\\n\\n## General-purpose models\\n- **1.1B:** [TinyDolphin 2.8 1.1B](https://huggingface.co/Crataco/TinyDolphin-2.8-1.1b-imatrix-GGUF). Takes about ~700MB RAM and tested on my Pi 4 with 2 gigs of RAM. Hallucinates a lot, but works for basic conversation.\\n- **2.7B:** [Dolphin 2.6 Phi-2](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/dolphin-2_6-phi-2-GGUF). Takes over ~2GB RAM and tested on my 3GB 32-bit phone via llama.cpp on Termux. \\n- **7B:** [Nous Hermes Mistral 7B DPO](https://huggingface.co/Crataco/Nous-Hermes-2-Mistral-7B-DPO-imatrix-GGUF). Takes about ~4-5GB RAM depending on context length. Works on my laptop with 8GB RAM.\\n- **10.7B:** [Nous Hermes 2 SOLAR 10.7B](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Nous-Hermes-2-SOLAR-10.7B-GGUF). Takes about ~6-8GB RAM depending on context length. Works on my server PCs and my primary PC (16GB RAM, 4GB VRAM).\\n- **8x7B:** [Nous Hermes 2 Mixtral 8x7B DPO](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7B-DPO-i1-GGUF). At IQ3_S it can run on a laptop with 16GB RAM and 8GB VRAM with 10-11 layers offloaded at 4096 ctx, but I recall it\\'s slightly slower than Q3_K_S (which I had a more consistent ~4.4 tokens/sec with).\\n\\n## Roleplay models\\n- **7B:** [Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B](https://huggingface.co/brittlewis12/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B-GGUF) is my most reliable, but I **love** [Erosumika](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Erosumika-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix), which sacrifices the logical yet synthetic GPT dataset for something more organic, similar to older models like Noromaid, Pygmalion 6B, and AI Dungeon 2.\\n- **10.7B:** [Fimbulvetr-11B-v2](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/Fimbulvetr-11B-v2-i1-GGUF). I haven\\'t tested it nearly as much as Kunoichi, so I can\\'t vouch for it.\\n- **8x7B:** [BagelMIsteryTour-v2-8x7B](https://huggingface.co/ycros/BagelMIsteryTour-v2-8x7B-GGUF), my favorite model for roleplaying if I have the resources to run it. It\\'s a bit of a behemoth but has the same requirements as Nous Hermes 2 Mixtral 8x7B DPO.\\n\\nAnd some extra information, while I\\'m at it:\\n\\n## Frontends\\nI alternate between using:\\n\\n- [ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama). Terminal client. Automatically offloads GPU layers, easy to download and get a model running, etc. But it [lags behind upstream llama.cpp](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/pull/1825).\\n- [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp). Upstream project, minimal overhead, pretty CLI-heavy. With cmake, I was able to compile the latest commit (c47cf41) on my 32-bit Android phone.\\n- [SillyTavern](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern) connected to [KoboldCpp](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp), usually if I\\'m using a model hosted from another PC, want to do a roleplay, or use its built-in RAG capability (vector storage).\\n\\n## Settings\\n- For general chatting, I have my settings set to Min P at 0.1 (0.01 for 8x7B models) and temperature at 1.0.\\n- For roleplaying, I can lower the min P to 0.05 (0.001 for 8x7B models) and/or set the \"smoothing\" value (quadratic sampling) to 0.23, occasionally raising the temperature and toying with it being first or last in the sampler order.', \"Midnight-Miqu-103B-v1.0 for creative writing, it's noticeably more intelligent then even the best 70B models.\", '### Use case:\\n\\nRoleplay chatting with character cards. Small models.\\n\\nI mostly look for strong character card adherence, system prompt following, response formatting, general coherence and models that will just go along with the most hardcore NSFW roleplay without resistance.\\n\\nRecommendations are always welcome.\\n\\n  - Backend: KoboldCpp (`--contextsize 8192`)\\n  - Frontend: SillyTavern\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Models:\\n\\n1) InfinityRP (7B)\\n\\nAn overall great model with solid character following and great response formatting. Seems to know not to write/speak for the {{user}} and when to stop.\\n\\n\"This model was basically made to stop some upsetting hallucinations, so {{char}} mostly and occasionally will wait {{user}} response instead of responding itself or deciding for {{user}}, also, my primary idea was to create a cozy model that thinks.\"\\n\\n  - Model: [Endevor/InfinityRP-v1-7B](https://huggingface.co/Endevor/InfinityRP-v1-7B)\\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/InfinityRP-v1-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/InfinityRP-v1-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\\n\\n---\\n\\n2) BuRP (7B)\\n\\nSimilar to the above, but with more unalignment. Generally also pretty solid with a slightly different style you might like compared to the original InfinityRP.\\n\\nThe model card feels like a personal *attack* on my formatting complaints and I can respect that.\\n\\n\"So you want a model that can do it all? You\\'ve been dying to RP with a superintelligence who never refuses your advances while sticking to your strange and oddly specific dialogue format? Well, look no further because BuRP is the model you need.\"\\n\\n  - Model: [ChaoticNeutrals/BuRP_7B](https://huggingface.co/ChaoticNeutrals/BuRP_7B)\\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/BuRP_7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/BuRP_7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\\n\\n---\\n\\n3) Layris (9B)\\n\\nThis passthrough Eris merge aimed to bring a high scoring model together with Layla-V4. It has shown to be smart and unaligned. Also a good option in this parameter size for our use case.\\n\\n  - Model: [ChaoticNeutrals/Layris_9B](https://huggingface.co/ChaoticNeutrals/Layris_9B/)\\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/Layris_9B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Layris_9B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\\n\\n---\\n\\n4) Infinitely-Laydiculous (7B)\\n\\nI really like InfinityRP\\'s style, and wanted to see it merged with Layla-V4 for her absolute unhingedness/unalignment.\\n\\n  - Model: [Nitral-AI/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B](https://huggingface.co/Nitral-AI/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B)\\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\\n\\n---\\n\\n5) Kunoichi-DPO-v2 (7B)\\n\\nGreat all around choice. Widely recommended by many users. Punches above what you\\'d expect.\\n\\n  - Model: [SanjiWatsuki/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B](https://huggingface.co/SanjiWatsuki/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B)\\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B-GGUF-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B-GGUF-Imatrix)\\n\\n---\\n\\n6) Layla-V4 (7B)\\n\\nThis model has been stripped out of all refusals.

Is that prompt works? Can you describe it more specifically?', \"\\\\- Don't ask AI to write entire projects for you, end to end.\\n\\n\\\\-  Ask it for the equivalent of a pizza base, which you can then add individual ingredients to yourself.\\n\\nWhen I try and ask a language model to create a tesselating hexagonal grid, none of them can do it.  Yet they can all generate a single hexagon.  So first I asked Claude Instant to give me the code for drawing a single hexagon, and then I asked him how to emulate FORTH's functionality in Python, where functions are associated with numbers, and can therefore be grouped together to form new composite functions.  Armed with those two pieces of information, I was able, with some more research on the Python Turtle API, to write code to generate a recursive hexagonal grid; that is, a grid of small hexagons, which in turn form one larger hexagon.\\n\\nThe reason why language models are so good at code boilerplate/include statements, is because boilerplate and include statements are the two most frequently occurring elements of programming languages, within the models' training data.  They are not good at generating hexagonal grids, because most normal humans are not like me, and are not morbidly obsessed with hexagons.  In code terms, a language model is a template generator.  It can't solve problems itself, because it does not think.  It just regurgitates pre-written examples from its' training data, and assembles them together based on the sequence that exists within its' training data.\\n\\n>A couple times it needlessly complicated the code\\n\\nLanguage models can not preserve state.  So it is very important to ask it to perform multiple tasks within the same operation, as infrequently as possible.  You are better off first asking it to ***identify*** a required series of steps in order to solve your current problem.  They are usually surprisingly good at that.  Once you have that list, go to the next layer of recursion, and ask for a series of steps to achieve that particular milestone.  Then, if necessary, recurse again, and repeat.  Recursion beyond around five levels, however, should generally be avoided, if possible.  It has an unfortunate tendency to cause intense, migraine induced vomiting, and psychotic breakdowns.\", \"I totally agree, these models are a blast for handling computer related problems.

I'm as fascinated as anyone by the possibilities of how this stuff could change our world, and it is super-exciting to watch this technology evolve into a way that anyone at home could have it - it's like unboxing your first Commodore 64 all over again.\\n\\nBut nothing has moved technology along like our base human desires, and I am human too.\\n\\n**Westlake-10.7B-v2** is the newcomer to the dirty games and fits in as little as 8GB.  Almost anyone with a mid-spec gaming rig can run this well and get their fix, and competes very well with the classic 70B+ models, which is nothing short of amazing.  You could stop here and just get this one and you will leave this thread happy.\\n\\nAnything with Noromaid in it is a staple of rip your clothes off style raunch, a few flavors are worth mentioning.  **Noromaid 20B, EstopianMaid 13B, Noromaid-0.4-Mixtral-8x7B-ZLoss**, and the new **MiquMaid** variants will do their worst to you with even the slightest suggestion.\\n\\nFor a more intelligent good time with a slower burn, and if you have lots of VRAM (48GB recommended), consider **Midnight-Rose** or **Midnight-Miqu** (less smutty and more smutty, respectively), in their 70B or 103B forms.  Even at small quants, IQ2 or IQ3, they write very well, just be a little more patient.  They'll run very well on 2x RTX 3090s.\\n\\nAnd whatever you do, don't reply with anything else that might arouse, titillate, or seduce someone into taking an imaginary partner or thirty into their own hand.\",\n",
       "   'I test models on a wide range of devices, so I have several favorites depending on the size.\\n\\n## General-purpose models\\n- **1.1B:** [TinyDolphin 2.8 1.1B](https://huggingface.co/Crataco/TinyDolphin-2.8-1.1b-imatrix-GGUF). Takes about ~700MB RAM and tested on my Pi 4 with 2 gigs of RAM. Hallucinates a lot, but works for basic conversation.\\n- **2.7B:** [Dolphin 2.6 Phi-2](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/dolphin-2_6-phi-2-GGUF). Takes over ~2GB RAM and tested on my 3GB 32-bit phone via llama.cpp on Termux. \\n- **7B:** [Nous Hermes Mistral 7B DPO](https://huggingface.co/Crataco/Nous-Hermes-2-Mistral-7B-DPO-imatrix-GGUF). Takes about ~4-5GB RAM depending on context length. Works on my laptop with 8GB RAM.\\n- **10.7B:** [Nous Hermes 2 SOLAR 10.7B](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Nous-Hermes-2-SOLAR-10.7B-GGUF). Takes about ~6-8GB RAM depending on context length. Works on my server PCs and my primary PC (16GB RAM, 4GB VRAM).\\n- **8x7B:** [Nous Hermes 2 Mixtral 8x7B DPO](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7B-DPO-i1-GGUF). At IQ3_S it can run on a laptop with 16GB RAM and 8GB VRAM with 10-11 layers offloaded at 4096 ctx, but I recall it\\'s slightly slower than Q3_K_S (which I had a more consistent ~4.4 tokens/sec with).\\n\\n## Roleplay models\\n- **7B:** [Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B](https://huggingface.co/brittlewis12/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B-GGUF) is my most reliable, but I **love** [Erosumika](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Erosumika-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix), which sacrifices the logical yet synthetic GPT dataset for something more organic, similar to older models like Noromaid, Pygmalion 6B, and AI Dungeon 2.\\n- **10.7B:** [Fimbulvetr-11B-v2](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/Fimbulvetr-11B-v2-i1-GGUF). I haven\\'t tested it nearly as much as Kunoichi, so I can\\'t vouch for it.\\n- **8x7B:** [BagelMIsteryTour-v2-8x7B](https://huggingface.co/ycros/BagelMIsteryTour-v2-8x7B-GGUF), my favorite model for roleplaying if I have the resources to run it. It\\'s a bit of a behemoth but has the same requirements as Nous Hermes 2 Mixtral 8x7B DPO.\\n\\nAnd some extra information, while I\\'m at it:\\n\\n## Frontends\\nI alternate between using:\\n\\n- [ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama). Terminal client. Automatically offloads GPU layers, easy to download and get a model running, etc. But it [lags behind upstream llama.cpp](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/pull/1825).\\n- [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp). Upstream project, minimal overhead, pretty CLI-heavy. With cmake, I was able to compile the latest commit (c47cf41) on my 32-bit Android phone.\\n- [SillyTavern](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern) connected to [KoboldCpp](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp), usually if I\\'m using a model hosted from another PC, want to do a roleplay, or use its built-in RAG capability (vector storage).\\n\\n## Settings\\n- For general chatting, I have my settings set to Min P at 0.1 (0.01 for 8x7B models) and temperature at 1.0.\\n- For roleplaying, I can lower the min P to 0.05 (0.001 for 8x7B models) and/or set the \"smoothing\" value (quadratic sampling) to 0.23, occasionally raising the temperature and toying with it being first or last in the sampler order.',\n",

       "   '### Use case:\\n\\nRoleplay chatting with character cards. Small models.\\n\\nI mostly look for strong character card adherence, system prompt following, response formatting, general coherence and models that will just go along with the most hardcore NSFW roleplay without resistance.\\n\\nRecommendations are always welcome.\\n\\n  - Backend: KoboldCpp (`--contextsize 8192`)\\n  - Frontend: SillyTavern\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Models:\\n\\n1) InfinityRP (7B)\\n\\nAn overall great model with solid character following and great response formatting. Seems to know not to write/speak for the {{user}} and when to stop.\\n\\n\"This model was basically made to stop some upsetting hallucinations, so {{char}} mostly and occasionally will wait {{user}} response instead of responding itself or deciding for {{user}}, also, my primary idea was to create a cozy model that thinks.\"\\n\\n  - Model: [Endevor/InfinityRP-v1-7B](https://huggingface.co/Endevor/InfinityRP-v1-7B)\\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/InfinityRP-v1-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/InfinityRP-v1-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\\n\\n---\\n\\n2) BuRP (7B)\\n\\nSimilar to the above, but with more unalignment. Generally also pretty solid with a slightly different style you might like compared to the original InfinityRP.\\n\\nThe model card feels like a personal *attack* on my formatting complaints and I can respect that.\\n\\n\"So you want a model that can do it all? You\\'ve been dying to RP with a superintelligence who never refuses your advances while sticking to your strange and oddly specific dialogue format? Well, look no further because BuRP is the model you need.\"\\n\\n  - Model: [ChaoticNeutrals/BuRP_7B](https://huggingface.co/ChaoticNeutrals/BuRP_7B)\\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/BuRP_7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/BuRP_7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\\n\\n---\\n\\n3) Layris (9B)\\n\\nThis passthrough Eris merge aimed to bring a high scoring model together with Layla-V4. It has shown to be smart and unaligned. Also a good option in this parameter size for our use case.\\n\\n  - Model: [ChaoticNeutrals/Layris_9B](https://huggingface.co/ChaoticNeutrals/Layris_9B/)\\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/Layris_9B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Layris_9B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\\n\\n---\\n\\n4) Infinitely-Laydiculous (7B)\\n\\nI really like InfinityRP\\'s style, and wanted to see it merged with Layla-V4 for her absolute unhingedness/unalignment.\\n\\n  - Model: [Nitral-AI/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B](https://huggingface.co/Nitral-AI/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B)\\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\\n\\n---\\n\\n5) Kunoichi-DPO-v2 (7B)\\n\\nGreat all around choice. Widely recommended by many users. Punches above what you\\'d expect.\\n\\n  - Model: [SanjiWatsuki/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B](https://huggingface.co/SanjiWatsuki/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B)\\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B-GGUF-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B-GGUF-Imatrix)\\n\\n---\\n\\n6) Layla-V4 (7B)\\n\\nThis model has been stripped out of all refusals.

To state it simply, the tests are pretty good, and require very little tweaking to get running. With the tests I have confidence in the code it generates.\\n\\nOnce, I even asked it to write a test for one of my own functions and it said it could do that but first I needed to know about a bug in the code, AND IT WAS RIGHT.\\n\\nAll of these little ventures to stackoverflow add up and I am convinced that using Mixtral has saved me one or two days just for this project that took about a week. For a project where I was more familiar with the programming language, I'm not sure the time saving would be so dramatic, but I'm impressed nonetheless.\\n\\nNow, this post wouldn't be complete without mentioning that it hasn't all been roses.

Yet they can all generate a single hexagon.  So first I asked Claude Instant to give me the code for drawing a single hexagon, and then I asked him how to emulate FORTH's functionality in Python, where functions are associated with numbers, and can therefore be grouped together to form new composite functions.  Armed with those two pieces of information, I was able, with some more research on the Python Turtle API, to write code to generate a recursive hexagonal grid; that is, a grid of small hexagons, which in turn form one larger hexagon.\\n\\nThe reason why language models are so good at code boilerplate/include statements, is because boilerplate and include statements are the two most frequently occurring elements of programming languages, within the models' training data.  They are not good at generating hexagonal grids, because most normal humans are not like me, and are not morbidly obsessed with hexagons.  In code terms, a language model is a template generator.  It can't solve problems itself, because it does not think.  It just regurgitates pre-written examples from its' training data, and assembles them together based on the sequence that exists within its' training data.\\n\\n>A couple times it needlessly complicated the code\\n\\nLanguage models can not preserve state.  So it is very important to ask it to perform multiple tasks within the same operation, as infrequently as possible.  You are better off first asking it to ***identify*** a required series of steps in order to solve your current problem.  They are usually surprisingly good at that.  Once you have that list, go to the next layer of recursion, and ask for a series of steps to achieve that particular milestone.  Then, if necessary, recurse again, and repeat.  Recursion beyond around five levels, however, should generally be avoided, if possible.  It has an unfortunate tendency to cause intense, migraine induced vomiting, and psychotic breakdowns.\",\n",

What we couldn't figure out is how they were so quick with summarizing the resulting web searches. \\n\\nWe tried a whole slew of hacky tactics from parallelizing the scraping and summarization of the content, indexing/embedding searches, recursive summaries, etc. They always took >\\\\~30 seconds. \\n\\nIn the end, we would've saved more time if we lobotomized ourselves and just did the easy thing -- use the snippets provided by SerpAPI. You know the one-two sentence blurb underneath each of the search links? Usually, the answer is directly in these. In essence, perplexity is letting the search providers do the heavy lifting in indexing and surfacing the answers to these questions, then having an LLM fill in the gaps / hallucinate the rest. \\n\\nIn a weekend we were able to get almost near exact results in the same amount of time with a serpAPI call and a gpt 3.5 turbo request.

       "  'content': \"*What this is: I've been writing about prompting for a few months on my free personal blog, but I felt that some of the ideas might be useful to people building with AI over here too. So, I'm sharing a post! Tell me what you think.*\\n\\n**If you’ve built any complex LLM system** **there’s a good chance that the model has** [**consistently done something**](https://promptingweekly.substack.com/p/prompting-principle-consistent-behavior) **that you don’t want it to do.** You might have been using GPT-4 or some other powerful, [inflexible](https://promptingweekly.substack.com/p/mistral-large-and-mistral-medium?utm_source=profile&utm_medium=reader2) model, and so maybe you “solved” (or at least mitigated) this problem by writing a long list of what the model must and must not do. Maybe that had an effect, but depending on how tricky the problem is, it may have even made the problem worse — especially if you were using open source models. What gives?\\n\\nThere was a time, a long time ago (read: last week, things move *fast*) when I believed that the power of the pattern was absolute, and that LLMs were such powerful pattern completers that when predicting something they would only “look” in the areas of their prompt that corresponded to the part of the pattern they were completing. So if their handwritten prompt was something like this (repeated characters represent similar information):\\n\\n>Information:  \\n**AAAAAAAAAAA 1**  \\n**BB 1**  \\n**CCCC 1**  \\n>  \\n>  \\nResponse:  \\n**DD 1**  \\n>  \\n>  \\nInformation:  \\n**AAAAAAAAA 2**  \\n**BBBBB 2**  \\n**CCC 2**  \\n>  \\n>  \\nResponse:  \\n**DD 2**  \\n>  \\n>  \\nInformation:  \\n**AAAAAAAAAAAAAA 3**  \\n**BBBB 3**  \\n**CCCC 3**  \\n>  \\n>  \\nResponse  \\n← if it was currently here and the task is to produce something like **DD 3**\\n\\nI thought it would be paying most attention to the information A2, B2, and C2, and especially the previous parts of the pattern, DD 1 and DD 2. If I had two or three of the examples like the first one, the only “reasonable” pattern continuation would be to write something with only Ds in it\\n\\nBut taking this abstract analogy further, I found the results were often more like\\n\\n>**AADB**\\n\\nThis made no sense to me. All the examples showed this prompt only including information D in the response, so why were A and B leaking? Following my prompting principle that [“consistent behavior has a specific cause”](https://promptingweekly.substack.com/p/prompting-principle-consistent-behavior), I searched the example responses for any trace of A or B in them. But there was nothing there.\\n\\nThis problem persisted for months in [Augmentoolkit](https://github.com/e-p-armstrong). Originally it took the form of the questions almost always including something like **“according to the text”.** I’d get questions like “What is x… **according to the text?**” All this, despite the fact that none of the example questions even had the word “text” in them. I kept getting As and Bs in my responses, despite the fact that all the examples only had D in them.\\n\\nOriginally this problem had been covered up with a [“if you can’t fix it, feature it”](https://www.amazon.ca/Secrets-Consulting-Giving-Getting-Successfully/dp/0932633013) approach. Including the name of the actual text in the context made the references to “the text” explicit: “What is x… according to Simple Sabotage, by the Office of Strategic Services?” That question is answerable by itself and makes more sense. But when multiple important users asked for a version that didn’t reference the text, my usage of the ‘Bolden Rule’ fell apart. I had to do something. \\n\\nSo at 3:30 AM, after a number of frustrating failed attempts at solving the problem, I tried something unorthodox. **The “A” in my actual use case appeared in the chain of thought step,** which referenced “the text” multiple times while analyzing it to brainstorm questions according to certain categories. It had to call the input something, after all. So I thought, ***“What if I just delete the chain of thought step?”***\\n\\nI tried it. I generated a small trial dataset. The result? No more “the text” in the questions. The actual questions were better and more varied, too. The next day, two separate people messaged me with cases of Augmentoolkit performing well — even better than it had on my test inputs. And I’m sure it wouldn’t have been close to that level of performance without the change. \\n\\nThere ***was*** a [specific cause](https://promptingweekly.substack.com/p/prompting-principle-consistent-behavior) for this problem, but it had nothing to do with a faulty pattern: rather, the model was consistently drawing on information from the wrong part of the prompt. This wasn’t the pattern's fault: the model was using information in a way it *shouldn’t have been.* **But the fix was still under the prompter’s control**, because **by removing the source of the erroneous information, the model was not “tempted” to use that information.** In this way, telling the model not to do something probably makes it more likely to do that thing, if the model is not properly fine-tuned: you’re adding more instances of the problematic information, and the more of it that’s there, the more likely it is to leak. When “the text” was leaking in basically every question, the words “the text” appeared roughly **50 times** in that prompt’s examples (in the chain of thought sections of the input). Clearly that information was leaking and influencing the generated questions, even if it was never used in the actual example questions themselves. This implies the existence of another prompting principle: **models learn from the entire prompt, not just the part it’s currently completing.** You can extend or modify this into two other forms: **models are like people — you need to repeat things to them if you want them to do something**; and **if you repeat something in your prompt, regardless of where it is, the model is likely to draw on it.** Together, these principles offer a plethora of new ways to fix up a misbehaving prompt (removing repeated extraneous information), or to induce new behavior in an existing one (adding it in multiple places). \\n\\n**There’s clearly more to model behavior than examples alone:** though repetition offers less fine control, it’s also much easier to write. For a recent client project I was able to handle an entirely new requirement, even after my multi-thousand-token examples had been written, by repeating the instruction at the beginning of the prompt, the middle, and right at the end, near the user’s query. Between examples and repetition, the open-source prompter should have all the systematic tools they need to craft beautiful LLM instructions. And since these models, unlike OpenAI’s GPT models, are not overtrained, the prompter has more control over how it behaves: the “specific cause” of the “consistent behavior” is almost always within your context window, not the thing’s proprietary dataset.\\n\\n**Hopefully these prompting principles expand your prompt engineer’s toolkit!** These were entirely learned from my experience building AI tools: they are not what you’ll find in any research paper, and as a result they probably won’t appear in basically any other AI blog. Still, discovering this sort of thing and applying it is fun, and sharing it is enjoyable. [Augmentoolkit](https://github.com/e-p-armstrong/augmentoolkit) received some updates lately while I was implementing this change and others — now it has a Python script, a config file, API usage enabled, and more — so if you’ve used it before, but found it difficult to get started with, now’s a great time to jump back in. And of course, applying the principle that repetition influences behavior, don’t forget that I have a consulting practice specializing in Augmentoolkit and improving open model outputs :)\\n\\n*Alright that's it for this crosspost.

      "\n",
      "**Tendances actuelles de l'IA**\n",
      "\n",
      "Au cours des dernières semaines, plusieurs modèles de langage pré-entraînés ont suscité beaucoup d'attention et de discussions dans la communauté de l'IA. Certains modèles en particulier, tels que StarCoder 2, MoAI, Large World Model et Command-R, ont été salués pour leur performance exceptionnelle dans des tâches spécifiques telles que la génération de code, la compréhension du langage, la génération de musique, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "De plus, le développement de modèles plus grands et plus puissants continue de repousser les limites de l'IA. Les informations récemment dévoilées sur un modèle contenant 1,8 billion de paramètres ont suscité beaucoup d'excitation et de spéculations quant à son origine et à son potentiel.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Débats clés sur l'IA**\n",
      "\n",
      "Les discussions autour de l'utilisation éthique de l'intelligence artificielle, de la confidentialité des données et de la responsabilité des modèles d'IA ont été des sujets brûlants ces dernières semaines. Les membres du subreddit ont débattu des implications de ces technologies émergentes pour la société et ont échangé leurs points de vue sur la réglementation et les politiques nécessaires pour encadrer leur utilisation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Un autre débat animé a été celui de la démocratisation de l'IA, avec des discussions sur la manière de rendre ces technologies plus accessibles à un large public tout en maintenant des normes éthiques élevées.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Analyses et implications pour les professionnels de l'IA**\n",
      "\n",
      "Les tendances actuelles de l'IA et les débats en cours ont des implications importantes pour les professionnels de l'IA et les passionnés du domaine. L'émergence de modèles plus puissants offre de nouvelles possibilités pour résoudre des problèmes complexes et stimuler l'innovation. Cependant, cela soulève également des questions sur l'éthique, la confidentialité et la responsabilité.\n",
      "\n",
      "Les professionnels de l'IA doivent être conscients de ces débats et tenir compte des considérations éthiques lors de la conception et de l'utilisation de modèles d'IA.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Citations des contributions d'utilisateurs**\n",

      "Dans les discussions les plus engageantes du subreddit, certaines citations ont retenu notre attention :\n",
      "\n",
      "- *\"Les modèles d'IA deviennent de plus en plus puissants, mais cela soulève des questions éthiques et des responsabilités pour ceux qui les développent. Nous devons nous assurer que l'IA est toujours utilisée de manière éthique et qu'elle respecte les droits et les valeurs fondamentales de notre société.\"*\n",
      "\n",
      "- *\"La démocratisation de l'IA est une nécessité pour un véritable progrès. Nous devons rendre ces technologies accessibles à tous, afin de maximiser leur impact positif sur la société.\"*\n",
